 * Support/company details shown on the legal pages and the rider, driver and

 * These used to be a hardcoded block describing a different product entirely —
 * another company's name, owner, Noida address, phone number and an email
 * containing a space — which shipped publicly on /terms and /privacy and inside
 * both apps. They now come from the CMS contact section, so the admin panel is
 * the one place they are set.

 * The owner is the first founder on the About page (CMS about.founders), so
 * renaming them there updates the support and legal pages too.
